# Hi there, I'm Ashwini Raj 👋

## Test Automation Engineer | SDET

Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) with a strong focus on building **scalable, maintainable automation frameworks** for mobile and API testing.

I design test architecture from scratch, improve CI pipelines, and keep automation practical rather than overengineered. I work closely with engineering teams to
ensure automation delivers reliable and actionable feedback.
